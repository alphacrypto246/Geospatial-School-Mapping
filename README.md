# Geospatial School Mapping

The Geospatial School Mapping project uses geographic data to map and analyze the locations of schools in a specific region. By leveraging geospatial analysis techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the distribution and accessibility of schools, helping policymakers and the community make informed decisions.

## Features

- **School Location Mapping**: Plots school locations on a map based on geographic coordinates.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes the distribution of schools across regions.
- **Accessibility Insights**: Provides insights into areas with limited access to schools.
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps to visualize school locations and their proximity to other regions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Geospatial Libraries**: Such as `GeoPandas`, `Folium`, and `Shapely` for map visualization and spatial analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
